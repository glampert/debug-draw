This software is in the public domain. Where that dedication is not recognized,
you are granted a perpetual, irrevocable license to copy, distribute, and modify

No attribution is required, but a mention about the author(s) is appreciated.

## Using Debug Draw

Debug Draw is a single source file library, so the "header" forward declarations and
the implementation are contained in the same file (`debug_draw.hpp`). This should facilitate
deployment and integration with your own projects. All you have to do is `#include` the library
file in one of your own source files and define `DEBUG_DRAW_IMPLEMENTATION` in that
file to generate the implementation. You can also still include the library in other
places. When `DEBUG_DRAW_IMPLEMENTATION` is not defined, it acts as a normal C++ header file.
Example:

In `my_program.cpp`:

```cpp
#define DEBUG_DRAW_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "debug_draw.hpp"
```

Now in `my_program.hpp` or any other header or source file,
you can include it as a normal C++ header:

```cpp
#include "debug_draw.hpp"
```

That's it, you should now be able to build Debug Draw into your own application.

### Interfacing with your renderer

Debug Draw doesn't make assumptions about the underlaying renderer API, so it can be
integrated very easily with Direct3D or OpenGL or any other rendering engine of
your choice. All that is required is that you provide an implementation for the
`dd::RenderInterface` abstract class, which provides Debug Draw with basic methods
to draw points, lines and character glyphs. The following is what `dd::RenderInterface` looks like:

```cpp
class RenderInterface
{
public:
    virtual void beginDraw();
    virtual void endDraw();

    virtual void drawPointList(const DrawVertex * points, int count, bool depthEnabled);
    virtual void drawLineList(const DrawVertex * lines, int count, bool depthEnabled);
    virtual void drawGlyphList(const DrawVertex * glyphs, int count, GlyphTextureHandle glyphTex);

    virtual GlyphTextureHandle createGlyphTexture(int width, int height, const void * pixels);
    virtual void destroyGlyphTexture(GlyphTextureHandle glyphTex);

    virtual ~RenderInterface() = 0;
};
```

Not all methods have to be implemented, you decide which features to support!
Look into the source code for the declaration of `RenderInterface`. Each method is
well commented and describes the expected behavior that you should implement.
For reference implementations of the `RenderInterface` using standard APIs like OpenGL,
refer to the `samples/` directory in this project.

Once you implement a `RenderInterface` for your renderer, all you need to do before starting
to use Debug Draw is to call `dd::initialize()` passing it a pointer to your custom `RenderInterface`:

```cpp
MyRenderInterface renderIface;
dd::initialize(&renderIface);
```

Note however that Debug Draw batches all primitives to reduce the number of calls to `RenderInterface`,
so drawing will only actually take place by the time you call `dd::flush()`, which is normally done
at the end of a frame, before flipping the screen buffers:

```cpp
// You only have to pass the current time if you have
// timed debug draws in the queues. Otherwise just pass 0.
dd::flush(getTimeMilliseconds());
```

So the overall setup should look something like the following:

```cpp
class MyRenderInterface : public dd::RenderInterface
{
    // Cherrypick the methods you want to implement or implement them all
    ...
};

int main()
{
    MyRenderInterface renderIface;
    dd::initialize(&renderIface);

    while (!quitting)
    {
        // Any other drawing that you already do
        ...

        // Call any dd:: functions to add debug primitives to the draw queues
        ...

        dd::flush(getTimeMilliseconds());

        // Swap buffers to present the scene
        ...
    }

    dd::shutdown();
}
```

### Configuration switches

Debug Draw provides several compiler switches for library configuration and customization.
Check the documentation in `debug_draw.hpp` for a list of all switches plus detailed description of each.

### Language requirements

The library has very few language requirements. One of its main goals is to be painless to integrate
and also to be very portable. The only requirement is a C++98 compiler or better. We check for the
availability of a few interesting C++11 features, but fall-backs are provided so you can also integrate
it with older projects.

RTTI and C++ Exceptions **are not used**, so you should have no problems integrating
the library with projects that disable those features.

The memory footprint is also small and you can manage the amount of memory that gets committed
to the internal queues via preprocessor directives. We currently only allocate a small amount of
dynamic memory at library startup to decompress the font glyphs for the debug text drawing functions.
Apart from that, all data used by the library is statically allocated as file scoped `static`s.

### Thread safety

By default, Debug Draw uses static data and *is not thread safe*, so its public API cannot be called from multiple threads. 

if this is a problem for you, such as in parallel rendering engines, or if you wish to generate debug geometry from simulation / game threads as well as from a rendering thread, you can choose to create multiple `dd::RenderContext` objects. All of the Debug Draw API's take an optional `dd::RenderContext*` as the last parameter, which represents the storage area used by the API call. Each context may only be used by one thread at a time, but you can create multiple contexts to allow multiple threads to use the API simultaneously. Call `dd::RenderContext::alloc` to allocate a context prior to calling `dd::initialize` and call `dd::RenderContext::free` to deallocate the context after calling `dd::shutdown`.

## Samples

Drawing a box with a set of coordinate axes in its center:

```cpp
const ddVec3 boxColor  = { 0.0f, 0.8f, 0.8f };
const ddVec3 boxCenter = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 3.0f };

dd::box(boxCenter, boxColor, 1.5f, 1.5f, 1.5f);
dd::cross(boxCenter, 1.0f);
```

To visualize a matrix transform, you can use `dd::axisTriad()`
to draw the transform as three arrows:

```cpp
const ddMat4x4 transform = { // The identity matrix
    1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
    0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
    0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,
    0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f
};
dd::axisTriad(transform, 0.3f, 2.0f);
```

More complex samples and how to integrate Debug Draw with your own renderer can
be found inside the `samples/` directory. Each function provided the API is also well
documented in the header file. You will find a descriptive header comment before
the prototype of each public function exposed by the library.
